## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or Windows 11
- Python 3.11 or Python 3.12
- Git installed
- Gemini API key
- OpenRouter API key (optional but recommended)

### 1. Clone the repository

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/titechprabhasolutions/Brahma-AI---Lite.git
cd "Karen"
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install
```

### 4. Configure API credentials

Create `config/api_keys.json` with your keys:

```json
{
  "gemini_api_key": "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY",
  "openrouter_api_key": "YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY"
}
```

#### Gemini API Key

1. Create a Google Cloud or Gemini account.
2. Enable Gemini API access for your project.
3. Add the generated key to `gemini_api_key`.

#### OpenRouter API Key

1. Register at https://openrouter.ai.
2. Generate an `sk-or-` API key.
3. Add the key to `openrouter_api_key`.

### 5. Optional: Configure Discord integration

If you want Discord remote control, populate `config/discord_bot.json` with your bot credentials and connection settings.

### 6. Launch Karen

```powershell
python main.py
```

For a cleaner startup experience on Windows:

```powershell
start_brahma.vbs
```

## Configuration

Core configuration files:

- `config/api_keys.json` — Gemini and OpenRouter credentials
- `config/app_settings.json` — voice, UI, startup, and automation preferences
- `config/brahma_connect.json` — device pairing, gateway, and discovery settings
- `config/discord_bot.json` — Discord bridge configuration

## Project Structure

- `main.py` — application startup, AI orchestration, and command routing
- `ui.py` — Qt-based desktop interface and live assistant controls
- `actions/` — modular automation, document, and assistant tools
- `brahma_connect/` — local gateway, pairing, and remote routing
- `config/` — local settings, credentials, and runtime configuration
- `plugins/` — optional plugin extensions
- `tests/` — integration and validation tests

## Plugin System

Extend Karen with custom Python plugins by adding files to `plugins/`.

Supported hooks:

- `on_brahma_created(brahma)` — called when the assistant instance is initialized
- `on_startup(brahma)` — called after startup when plugins are registered
- `on_text_command(text, source, brahma=None)` — called for each incoming text command; return `True` to indicate the command was handled

## Best Practices

- Keep credentials in `config/api_keys.json` and avoid committing secrets.
- Use the virtual environment for all development and runtime sessions.
- Restart the app after changing config or adding plugins.
- Review `config/app_settings.json` to tune voice, UI, and automation behavior.
